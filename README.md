## UFHome - 

Greetings, Earthling!

Welcome to UFHome, the destination for people looking to get closer to interplanetary action. Search for UFO sightings hot spots then find places to stay in or around where the sightings happen--extra points if you whisper “I want to believe” while searching.

## My Quest to Know!

It was a hot night in west Texas during the summer of 1999.  My two best friends and I were a trip of a life time to California to shred up the best street spots and skateparks the west coast had to offer!  At about eleven at night, my friend that was driving suddenly turned the radio off and yelled "WHAT THE **** IS THAT?"  We all looked out and to our left at something that we had never seen before!  A flying object surrounded by other lights that was traveling at an incredible speed. Since then I have always wanted to see something else like that but never really pursued the idea.  So, for this project, I decided to make it easier for others to do so!
